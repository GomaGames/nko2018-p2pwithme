# Overview

This server attempts to negotiate client requests to add to an updating list of connections.

If anything, it's a proxy server that shows whos actively connected to it.

# Design Goals

- Establish a standard API to allow other users to host their applications
  - URL registration
- Clients may update their listing with meta data to allow users a preview of what they're about to connect to.

# Notes

> Mother always warned me not to take links from strangers!
